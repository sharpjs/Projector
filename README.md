## Projector

Create Strongly-Typed Projections from Structured Data

This project was inspired by, and intends to replace, the DictionaryAdapter
component from the Castle Project.  All ideas taken from DictionaryAdapter
either are the original work of this project's author or were taken with the
permission of the original author.  No code from DictionaryAdapter appears in
this project.
